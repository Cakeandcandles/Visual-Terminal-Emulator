TermGraphFX is a modular terminal emulator that runs entirely in the browser. It acts like a UNIX-like command-line shell, and has a fake virtual file system.
It's features include, the ls and pwd commands for the displaying of the current directory and path, and cd for navigating the fake files, cat for displaying and reading the contents of those files, and you can always type 'help' for a list of commands.
It's also extremely easy to add to this project by adding new commands, new virtual files, and many more real terminal-like behavior.
